# my zsh

The first file read by **ZSH** which is relevant here is `~/.zshenv`.

Today its content is:

```
export ZDOTDIR=/Users/snk/.zdotdir
export HISTFILE=/Users/snk/.zdotdir/.zsh_history
export PATH="/Users/snk/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/opt/X11/bin"
```

The **ZDOTDIR** setted will be the path where **ZSH** will get its run
configurations files.
