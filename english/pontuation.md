(), [] and {}	may also be called brackets in general. In that case, they specifically call [] square brackets and {} curly brackets. I never like this. Open and Closing may also be called left and right.

!	exclamation; commonly read as bang in case of #!/bin/sh

~	tilde (sounds like til-da); be prepared to explain to computer-illiterate people saying "you know, the wave-shaped thingy"


#	pound; but commonly read as shee in case of #!/bin/sh, not sure why

^	caret; not many people know this word so be prepared to say "no, not carrot; it's the character above 6, an arrow pointing up"


(	opening parenthesis (some may shorten it saying paren)


_	underscore; once I heard people say underbar


-	minus; as symbol before arguments in commands, some people including me read dash, easier to say one syllable


\	backslash; be prepared to explain to some computer-illiterate people


<	less than; some may read left angle bracket

/	slash or forward slash; some computer-illiterate people may be confused about / and \
