# carriage return

This recipe was done because of differences between Unix an Windows.

**CR - Carriage Return**

**LF - Line Feed**

The Carriage Return (CR) is represented by ASCII number 13, and came from the movement of a typwriter to the left of a sheet of paper. Think “returning of the carriage” to the left.

> The Line Feed is represented by ASCII number 10, and it harkens back to the
> action of a typewriter rolling a piece of paper up by one line.
> Interestingly enough, the combination of these two functions is integrated into
> the ENTER/RETURN key.
> Also known as the CRLF character, this handy shortcut both moves you to the
> left and down a line.

> *Nix uses the LF character
> Macs use the CR character
> Windows uses both — with the CR coming before the LF
