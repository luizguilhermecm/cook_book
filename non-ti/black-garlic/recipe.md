> The process of producing black garlic is sometimes incorrectly referred to as

> is a type of caramelized garlic (a Maillard Reaction, not fermentation).

> I use a commercial black garlic production method as reference. Commercial
> garlic production requires temperature settings from 90C to 55C. Starting with
> high humidity and temperature, and then
> gradually lowering both.
>
> As rice cooker does not have humidity control, I use some wet paper towels to
> increase the humidity in the cooker.
>
> At “keep warm”, temperature inside the rice cooker is around 65C. We will have
> to adjust the period of “aging” based on the size of garlic and actual
> temperature of the rice cooker.

This is an article about black garlic and describe how some redneck does it.

**FIX:** the person I assumed beeing a redneck turns out to be a chef and
know I realized, the url of this article is **starchef**.

> [. . .]
> Processed at around 60°C/140°F for a month to six weekssed at around
> 60°C/140°F for a month to six weeks
> [. . .]

Is described a recipe in the topic **House-made, Farm-to-Table Approved**

> adds whole heads to a Lexan, which he covers tightly with plastic wrap and
> aluminum foil, creating an airtight seal and to hold in moisture.
> He then adds the Lexan to a large dehydrator to maintain a constant 140°F.
> He checks the garlic every few weeks, and usually pulls the deep black bulbs
> at 26 to 28 days.
> (He has also successfully tried the process with shallots, which require a
> shorter time in the dehydrator, he says.)

Long story short:

**Lexan** what is this shit?!

* Cover tightly with plastic wrap AND aluminium foil.
  * Creating an airtight seal and to hold in moisture.
* Maintain a constant 140ºF.
* 26 to 28 days to get a deep black bulb
