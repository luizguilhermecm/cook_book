The paper background abstract:

```
ABSTRACT
Background: Although consumption of 3 meals/d is the most common pattern of
eating in industrialized countries, a scientific rationale for this meal
frequency with respect to optimal health is lacking. A diet with less meal
frequency can improve the health and extend the lifespan of laboratory animals,
but its effect on humans has never been tested.

The results published:

```
Results: Subjects who completed the study maintained their body weight within 2
kg of their initial weight throughout the 6-mo period. There were no
significant effects of meal frequency on heart rate, body temperature, or most
of the blood variables measured. However, when consuming 1 meal/d, subjects
had a significant increase in hunger; a significant modification of body
composition, including reductions in fat mass; significant increases in blood
pressure and in total, LDL-, and HDL-cholesterol concentrations; and a
significant decrease in concentrations of cortisol.
```

The conclusions of paper:

```
Conclusions: Normal-weight subjects are able to comply with a 1 meal/d diet.
When meal frequency is decreased without a reduction in overall calorie intake,
modest changes occur in body composition, some cardiovascular disease risk
factors, and hematologic variables.
