posted one year ago.
The channel seens to be for people fanatic by gym.

The video begins by explaining what is **TEF** _Thermic Effect of Food_ and how
it influences in a diet.

At end, the guy conclusion is that meal frequency do not make any difference in
a two diets with same amount of calories.

The poor person doing the diet should choose a suitable meal frequency.

**"Comparison of Weight Loss Among Named Diet Programs in
Overweight and Obese Adults - A Meta-analysis"**

[artigo](http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1900510)

One video named
[A melhor dieta para emagrecer (prova científica), 11min15s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJph2JauSbc)
, explains the conclusion the
paper got.

The core of paper was to do a comparison of eleven diet programs, all of them
used most in USA, some of them in Brazil too.

The list of diet programs compared was:

1. Atkins,
1. Biggest Loser,
1. Jenny Craig,
1. LEARN,
1. Nutrisystem,
1. Ornish,
1. Rosemary Conley,
1. South Beach,
1. Vigilantes do Peso,
1. Volumetrics,
1. Zone,

Each of them is described in [this text](http://natugood.com/a-melhor-dieta-para-emagrecer/)

Long story short, the average weight loss was basically equal for all of them,
do not matter which diet program you do, the real deal is how much commitment
the person has with the program and the goal.

Abstract
There have been reports of an inverse relationship between meal frequency (MF)
and adiposity.
It has been postulated that this may be explained by favourable effects of
increased MF on appetite control and possibly on gut peptides as well.
The main goal of the present study was to investigate whether using a high MF
could lead to a greater weight loss than that obtained with a low MF under
conditions of similar energy restriction.
Subjects were randomised into two treatment arms (high MF = 3 meals+3 snacks/d
or low MF = 3 meals/d) and subjected to the same dietary energy restriction of
− 2931 kJ/d for 8 weeks.
Sixteen obese adults (n 8 women and 8 men; age 34·6 (sd 9·5); BMI 37·1 (sd 4·5)
kg/m2) completed the study.
Overall, there was a 4·7 % decrease in body weight (P < 0·01); similarly,
significant decreases were noted in fat mass ( − 3·1 (sd 2·9) kg; P < 0·01),
lean body mass ( − 2·0 (sd 3·1) kg; P < 0·05) and BMI ( − 1·7 (sd 0·8) kg/m2;
P < 0·01).
However, there were NS differences between the low- and high-MF groups for
adiposity indices, appetite measurements or gut peptides (peptide YY and
ghrelin) either before or after the intervention.
We conclude that increasing MF does not promote greater body weight loss under
the conditions described in the present study.

Resumo

The relative importance of eating frequency to weight control is poorly
understood.

This review examines the evidence to date on the role of eating frequency in
weight control in free-living adults.

The majority of cross-sectional studies in free-living adults show an inverse
relationship between eating frequency and adiposity; however, this is likely an
artifact produced by the underreporting of eating frequency concurrent with
underreporting of energy intake.

When implausible energy intake reporting (which is mostly underreporting) is
taken into account, the association between eating frequency and adiposity
becomes positive.

In studies in which eating frequency is prescribed and food intake is mostly
self-selected, there is either no effect or a minor positive effect of eating
frequency on energy intake.

Most of those studies have been short-term and lack the necessary dietary
biomarkers to validate reported energy intakes and eating frequencies.

In conclusion, there is some suggestion from cross-sectional studies in which
energy intake underreporting is taken into account and from experimental
studies to date that greater eating frequency may promote positive energy
balance.
However, experimental studies of longer-term duration that include objective
dietary biomarkers are necessary before firm conclusions about the relative
importance of eating frequency in weight control can be made.

The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of dietary protein
intake and eating frequency on perceived appetite, satiety, and hormonal
responses in overweight/obese men.

Thirteen men (age 51 ± 4 years; BMI 31.3 ± 0.8 kg/m2) consumed eucaloric diets
containing normal protein (79 ± 2 g protein/day; 14% of energy intake as
protein) or higher protein (138 ± 3 g protein/day; 25% of energy intake as
protein) equally divided among three eating occasions (3-EO; every 4 h) or six
eating occasions (6-EO; every 2 h) on four separate days in randomized order.

Hunger, fullness, plasma glucose, and hormonal responses were assessed
throughout 11 h.

No protein × eating frequency interactions were observed for any of the
outcomes.

Independent of eating frequency, higher protein led to greater daily fullness
(P < 0.05) and peptide YY (PYY) concentrations (P < 0.05).

In contrast, higher protein led to greater daily ghrelin concentrations (P <
0.05) vs. normal protein.

Protein quantity did not influence daily hunger, glucose, or insulin
concentrations.

Independent of dietary protein, 6-EO led to lower daily fullness (P < 0.05) and
PYY concentrations (P < 0.05).

The 6-EO also led to lower glucose (P < 0.05) and insulin concentrations (P <
0.05) vs. 3-EO.

Although the hunger-related perceived sensations and hormonal responses were
conflicting, the fullness-related responses were consistently greater with
higher protein intake but lower with increased eating frequency.

Collectively, these data suggest that higher protein intake promotes satiety
and challenge the concept that increasing the number of eating occasions
enhances satiety in overweight and obese men.

Abstract

Eating frequency has been inversely related to BMI but the impact of eating
frequency on weight loss is unclear.
This randomized controlled trial pilot study examined the effect of eating
frequency on hunger, energy intake, and weight loss during a 6-month behavioral
weight loss intervention.

* Objective:

```
The relationship between eating frequency and body fatness was tested in a
population sample.
```

* Design:

```
A cross-sectional survey on cardiovascular risk factors and a nutritional
survey were carried out from June 1996 to April 1997.
```

* Subjects:

```
Population sample of 330 free-living middle-aged men (45-64y).
```

* Measurements:

```
Body mass index (BMI), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) and nutritional survey (3-day record).
```

* Results:

```
In the whole sample, BMI and WHR decreased significantly (P < 0.05) along with
the increase of the number of eating occasions.

When low energy records were excluded, the trend for BMI and WHR according to
eating categories remained significant.

For WHR, averages were 0.98, 0.95, 0.94 and 0.93 for 1 -2, 3, 4 or 5 or more
feedings a day, respectively.

For BMI, mean values were 28.1, 26.2, 26.2 and 24.5 kg/m(2), respectively.

After adjustment for confounders (total energy intake or macronutrients, age,
educational level, smoking habits, physical activity and restrained diet), the
linear trend for BMI and WHR throughout feeding categories was significant when
the whole sample was considered.

This relationship remained similar when low energy records or when dieters were
excluded.
```

* Conclusion:

```
These results suggest that for an isoenergetic intake the increase of eating
frequency is associated with lower body fatness.
