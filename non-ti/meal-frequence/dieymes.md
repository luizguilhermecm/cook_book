Meal Frequency

#### Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health

Vou usar a Harvard pelo peso dela.

Descrição do site mantido por eles:

> The aim of the Harvard School of Public Health Obesity Prevention Source Web
> site is to provide timely information about obesity’s global causes,
> consequences, prevention, and control, for the public, health and public
> health practitioners, business and community leaders, and policymakers.

Nesta página, é citado e referenciado no [artigo][harvard_text] a frase:

> "But there have been conflicting findings on the relationship between meal
> frequency, snacking, and weight control, and more research is needed."

Mas para não encerrar o assunto com uma frase de um artigo, listo outros para
fortalecer a ideia.

#### Artigo do journals.cambridge.org: [Increased meal frequency does not promote greater weight loss in subjects who were prescribed an 8-week equi-energetic energy-restricted diet](http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=7499636&fileId=S0007114509992984)

_MF = Meal Frequency_.

> Abstract
>
> There have been reports of an inverse relationship between meal frequency (MF)
> and adiposity.
>
> It has been postulated that this may be explained by favourable effects of
> increased MF on appetite control and possibly on gut peptides as well.
>
> The main goal of the present study was to investigate whether using a high MF
> could lead to a greater weight loss than that obtained with a low MF under
> conditions of similar energy restriction.
>
> . . .
>
> However, there were NS differences between the low- and high-MF groups for
> adiposity indices, appetite measurements or gut peptides (peptide YY and
> ghrelin) either before or after the intervention.
> We conclude that increasing MF does not promote greater body weight loss under
> the conditions described in the present study.

> Resumo
>
> The relative importance of eating frequency to weight control is poorly
> understood.
>
> This review examines the evidence to date on the role of eating frequency in
> weight control in free-living adults.
>
> The majority of cross-sectional studies in free-living adults show an inverse
> relationship between eating frequency and adiposity; however, this is likely an
> artifact produced by the underreporting of eating frequency concurrent with
> underreporting of energy intake.
>
> When implausible energy intake reporting (which is mostly underreporting) is
> taken into account, the association between eating frequency and adiposity
> becomes positive.
>
> In studies in which eating frequency is prescribed and food intake is mostly
> self-selected, there is either no effect or a minor positive effect of eating
> frequency on energy intake.
>
> Most of those studies have been short-term and lack the necessary dietary
> biomarkers to validate reported energy intakes and eating frequencies.
>
> In conclusion, there is some suggestion from cross-sectional studies in which
> energy intake underreporting is taken into account and from experimental
> studies to date that greater eating frequency may promote positive energy
> balance.
>
> However, experimental studies of longer-term duration that include objective
> dietary biomarkers are necessary before firm conclusions about the relative
> importance of eating frequency in weight control can be made.

#### Artigo: [Eating frequency and body fatness in middle-aged men](http://apps.webofknowledge.com/InboundService.do?product=WOS&SID=4B9uWOrirDT9Ajkau6x&UT=WOS%3A000179503600008&SrcApp=Wiley_Online_Library&DestFail=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.webofknowledge.com&Init=Yes&action=retrieve&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&Func=Frame&customersID=LinksAMR&IsProductCode=Yes&mode=FullRecord)


* Objective:

> The relationship between eating frequency and body fatness was tested in a
> population sample.

* Design:

> A cross-sectional survey on cardiovascular risk factors and a nutritional
> survey were carried out from June 1996 to April 1997.

* Subjects:

> Population sample of 330 free-living middle-aged men (45-64y).

* Measurements:

> Body mass index (BMI), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) and nutritional survey (3-day record).

* Results:

> In the whole sample, BMI and WHR decreased significantly (P < 0.05) along with
> the increase of the number of eating occasions.
>
> When low energy records were excluded, the trend for BMI and WHR according to
> eating categories remained significant.
>
> . . .
>
> After adjustment for confounders (total energy intake or macronutrients, age,
> educational level, smoking habits, physical activity and restrained diet), the
> linear trend for BMI and WHR throughout feeding categories was significant when
> the whole sample was considered.
>
> This relationship remained similar when low energy records or when dieters were
> excluded.

* Conclusion:

> These results suggest that for an isoenergetic intake the increase of eating
> frequency is associated with lower body fatness.
